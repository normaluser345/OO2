    "Happy Birthday, my angel! If I could, I would write it across the sky so that everyone could see it and know that you are truly loved!",
    "I’d rather spend one moment holding you than a lifetime knowing I never could.",
    "Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive.",
    "If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.",
    "To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.",
    "You don’t love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear.",
    "You can’t blame gravity for falling in love.",
    "I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you.",
    "I love you more today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow.",
    "You smile, I smile. That’s how it works.",
    "All of me loves all of you.",
    "I’m much more me when I’m with you.",
    "In this huge world, among thousands of cities, millions of cars and houses, the hustle and bustle, lives a beautiful girl. The best girl. To you, I want to say: Good morning sweetheart.",
    "Every morning I wake up. I miss you, honey.",
    "I am thinking about four things this morning. The obstacle is the path, today is a good day, what comes is a gift, and I love you!",
    "You light up my life!",
    "You flourished and still flourish my life",
    "I am always excited to wake up each day because I know there’s someone worth waking up for. Good morning to the sweetest person I’ve ever known.",
    "I swear I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow.",
    "Waking up every morning knowing that you are there for me, light up my world brighter than the sun could ever be. Good morning to the love of my life.",
    "It is lovely, when I forget all birthdays, including my own, to find that somebody remembers me.",
    "Love, With every breath I take, I pray you know how much I love you. Happy Birthday to my everything.",
    "If I could give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me.",
    "I wish that the shoulder you rest your head upon is always mine. I wish the hand that supports you is mine. I wish the ears that listen to you when you talk is mine. I just want to be there for you always and forever.",
    "Sharing my life with you was the best decision I’ve ever made. I am grateful for every moment.",
    "B7WI",
    "BMWI",
    "YHOVI",
    "When I see you, I see the heaven in earth",
